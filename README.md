# Ravenous

This project utilizes the Yelp API to return a list of 10 businesses based on a cuisine type and location. This project is not fully functioning and is mainly to reinforce utilizing React to interact with APIs.

+ React

## Features

This program returns a list of 10 businesses based on 2 search inputs and 3 sort criteria. 

At the top of the search area are 3 sort options: Best Match, Rating, or Review Count. In combination with the 2 text input fields, one of these sort options are required in order to return results. 

Directly below the sort options are 2 text input fields. The first is for the type of business desired (e.g. Italian cuisine). The second input is for the desired location specified by city. 

Once all 3 inputs are completed and upon pressing the search button, a list of 10 unique businesses that closest match the criteria will be returned. This list will include an image selected by the business, the business name, the address, and the total review count. 

There is no further functionality as this project is mainly to exercise skills with React and API interaction. 

## Future Work

Possible future features may include: 
 
+ Being taken directly to the business page upon clicking the business image.

+ Integrating the Google Maps API to allow for business address viewing in Google Maps.

+ Autocompletion of addresses in the location input field.
